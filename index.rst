JupyterLab Unofficial Extensions & Tools
========================================

The `jupyterlab-contrib <https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/>`_ organization contains a collection of

and tools that add functionalities to `JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Each

repository if you encounter any problems, want to suggest a feature or an improvement or would like to help.
