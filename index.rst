JupyterLab Unofficial Extensions & Tools
========================================

The `jupyterlab-contrib <https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/`_ organization contains a collection of
community-contributed unofficial extensions
and tools that add functionalities to `JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Each
extension is stored in a independent GitHub repository.

Those repositories are maintained independently by a group of users and developers and not officially
related to the JupyterLab development team.

The maturity of the provided extensions varies. So please create an issue in the relevant extension github
repository if you encounter any problems or want to suggest a feature or an improvement.

If you want to transfer your extension within this organization, `open an issue <https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/issues/new?labels=transfer&template=transfer-repository-to-this-organization.md>`_.
If you want to help supporting the extensions in this organization, propose PRs and/or answer issues on the
relevant repositories. If the extension has been **archived**, you can `request access <https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/issues/new?template=help-with-maintenance.md>`_.
